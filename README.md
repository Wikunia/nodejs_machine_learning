# NodeJS Machine Learning
I am learning some stuff about machine learning and will use this repository to code some examples with nodeJS.
You have some improvements? Create an issue!

## General setup
I don't use any nodejs packages at the moment so just download this repo and use the simple `node filename` command.

## linearRegression
You can use `node linearRegression.js` to learn a linear regression function. 

Steps:

- specify your training data using the startData variable inside `linearRegression`
- to modify the training rate `alpha` and some other stuff you can change the `options` object
